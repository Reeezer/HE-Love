# HE-Love

HE-Love is a web application designed as an alternative to Tinder for the purpose of connecting and meeting people at HE-Arc school. 

The primary objective of this project is to provide a platform for students at HE-Arc to interact, get to know each other, and potentially form meaningful connections. HE-Love offers a user-friendly interface where users can create profiles, browse through other profiles, and express interest in potential matches.

The app allows users to view profiles of other HE-Arc students, providing essential information such as their name, profile picture, and a brief bio. Users can then indicate their interest in someone by swiping right, indicating a potential match. 

HE-Love also incorporates features to enhance the user experience and facilitate connections. It includes a chat system that enables matched users to communicate with each other directly within the app, fostering conversations and facilitating the process of getting to know each other.

With HE-Love, students at HE-Arc can have a dedicated platform to meet and connect with their fellow students, promoting a sense of community and fostering new relationships. The app offers a convenient and efficient way for students to socialize and expand their network within the HE-Arc community.
